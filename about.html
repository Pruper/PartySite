        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>With humble roots in 2021, the Renewal Party was established by a group of dedicated individuals determined
            to see change done to restore the American dream. Today, several years later, our mission has remained
            consistent. We seek to fix the flaws in our country and renew confidence in our government, both at home and
            abroad.</p>
        <p>The Renewal Party is committed to improving the lives of every American long term, by investing in the
            future, through infrastructure programs, energy investments, revitalizing the education system, and
            privatizing social security which will allow Americans more freedom to determine their future.</p>
        <p>Our main objective for the future is to begin getting people into Congress so that we may deploy our policies on the national scale, for the benefit of every American. If you're interested in helping us achieve our goal, please check our <a style="color:#99619E;" href="../involvement.html">Get Involved</a> page.</p>
