                    <td>The United States is facing a fiscal crisis as our national debt skyrockets, with American taxpayers suffering the burden of three billion dollars every day on interest alone. The Renewal Party is committed to balancing the budget by cutting federal spending on unnecessary programs, while ensuring the most essential services are preserved.</td>

                    <td>For a strong and sustainable economy in the future, we must encourage investment in renewable sources of energy such as wind, solar, and geothermal power as the world begins to reduce its dependency on oil. At the forefront of our energy policy, however, we strongly support investing into the construction of nuclear power plants, which can reliably power our country for centuries.</td>

                    <td>Jobs and the economy</td>
                    <td>The Renewal Party prioritizes job creation through supporting small businesses, innovation, and technological advancement. By lowering corporate taxes and reducing regulations, we aim to foster an environment where entrepreneurship can thrive. Additionally, we will invest in training programs to prepare the workforce for future industries, ensuring that Americans remain competitive in the global economy.</td>

                    <td>For the past two centuries, mankind has poisoned the earth's oceans and atmosphere with industrial abandon and pollution. The Renewal Party seeks to organize a global effort to reduce carbon emissions and clean up pollution. One of our main goals is to place a tax on carbon emissions to encourage corporations to adopt greener practices.</td>

                    <td>Social Security</td>
                    <td>With America's Social Security program set to become insolvent within the next two decades, the Renewal Party advocates to privatize social security, removing the burden of Americans not knowing whether they will see the money they pay in ever again. By allowing worker's private retirement fund contributions to be invested in private assets such as the stock market, workers will gain a much greater return, and a more secure future.</td>

                    <td>Healthcare</td>
                    <td>Healthcare in America is both expensive and inaccessible for many citizens. The Renewal Party seeks to reform the healthcare system by introducing a competitive, market-based approach that brings down costs while increasing access. We believe in empowering patients by giving them the freedom to choose their providers and insurers, rather than a one-size-fits-all government-run system.</td>

                    <td>Diversity and equality</td>
                    <td>America has often been described as a melting pot. The Renewal Party seeks to continue fostering an environment of diversity and equality by promoting policies that ensure every citizen has an equal chance to thrive, regardless of race, gender, or background.</td>

                    <td>Immigration</td>
                    <td>We believe that immigrants contribute very much to what makes this country great, but we do not support illegal immigration and border crossings. The Renewal Party will seek to create more legal immigration routes instead, and reduce restrictions on already existing ones.</td>

                    <td>Education</td>
                    <td>America's education system has seen serious decline in recent years. The Renewal Party seeks to revitalize the American education system to ensure that every child has the chance to succeed, regardless of their background. We strive to reduce the cost of college, to ensure that Americans do not need to go into lifelong debt for higher education.</td>

                    <td>The Renewal Party believes in a strong defense against terrorism, both foreign and domestic. We advocate for increased intelligence cooperation, advanced counter-terrorism tactics, and stronger security measures at critical infrastructure. However, we will always ensure that counter-terrorism efforts do not infringe on the civil liberties of law-abiding Americans.</td>
